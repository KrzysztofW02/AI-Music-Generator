# AI Music Generator

This project is an AI-driven music generation application that leverages deep learning to create original musical compositions. The core of this project involves preprocessing MIDI data, training a machine learning model, and providing a user-friendly interface to generate music using the trained model.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Convert MIDI files into a format suitable for training.
- **Model Training**: Train an LSTM-based neural network to generate music.
- **Music Generation**: Use the trained model to generate new musical compositions.
- **User Interface**: A graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5 for easy interaction.
